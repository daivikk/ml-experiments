Dividing `n` by these numbers, if n is divisible by any of them then it returns `False` (as it means that `n` has a divisor other than 1 and itself).\n\nIf `n` passes all these checks, it is a prime number, and the function returns `True`.",

Many Linked List problems often involve the manipulation of pointers in some kind, and reversing a linked list is a good way to get comfortable with pointer manipulation.\n\nThe code assumes the definition of the linked list node (i.e., `ListNode`).
