# 🧪 ML Experiments

Welcome to **ml-experiments** – a curated collection of small-scale machine learning experiments inspired by research papers across various subfields of ML.  

Each sub-folder in this repository contains:
- 📄 The **original paper** that inspired the experiment
- 🧠 A short **report** summarizing key takeaways, results, and learnings
- ✏️ A brief **note** on what I implemented, tweaked, or explored

Due to limited compute resources, many of these are small-scale reproductions or simplified adaptations of the original work – but they aim to capture the core insights and mechanics behind cutting-edge ML ideas.

## 🌟 Why This Exists
This repo is both a learning journal and a hands-on playground. By implementing ideas from research papers, I aim to:
- Deepen my understanding of state-of-the-art ML concepts
- Build a habit of reading and implementing academic work
- Share learnings with others in a structured, open way

## 👯‍♂️ Fun Fact
Many of these experiments were done in collaboration with my **twin brother, Daivik** – a fellow ML enthusiast and partner-in-crime for weekend hacks and coding sprints.

## 📚 Topics Covered So Far
- 🧠 LLM Safety & Alignment
- 🤖 Model Architecture
- 🧩 Datasets & Instruction Tuning
- 📊 Inference & Scaling
- 🔍 Computer Vision

## 📌 Disclaimer
These experiments are for **educational purposes only**. Most are *not* full replications due to time and compute constraints – they’re meant to convey the essence of the method rather than claim reproduction accuracy.
